# posthog Inventory

Inventory of our servers running the posthog service (https://posthog.com/)

Posthog has their own deployment method, outlined here: 
https://posthog.com/docs/self-host

It is best to follow their method, as posthog is a complex microservice
architecture whose exact configuration we don't want to try to recreate.


This inventory--and corresponding role and playbook--are mostly intended for
documentation, to show which posthog script we are running for installation.
