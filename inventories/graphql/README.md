# graphql Inventory

Potentially a historical inventory. Hosts in this inventory run a graphql server
that is meant to work in coordination with a room and our planetary web viewer.

This was supplanted by a setup where we run graphql, the rooms server, and the
web viewer frontend all on a single host.
